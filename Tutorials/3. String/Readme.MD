## String Operations

This section provides examples of common string operations in Python.

### Concatenation

Combining two or more strings.

```python
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
result = str1 + " " + str2
print(result)  # Output: Hello World
```

### Substring

Extracting a part of a string.

```python
str = "Hello World"
substring = str[0:5]
print(substring)  # Output: Hello
```

### Replace

Replacing a substring within a string.

```python
str = "Hello World"
new_str = str.replace("World", "Python")
print(new_str)  # Output: Hello Python
```

### Split

Splitting a string into a list of substrings.

```python
str = "Hello World"
words = str.split()
print(words)  # Output: ['Hello', 'World']
```

### Join

Joining a list of strings into a single string.

```python
words = ['Hello', 'World']
str = " ".join(words)
print(str)  # Output: Hello World
```
